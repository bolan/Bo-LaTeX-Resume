Bo-LaTeX-Resume
===============

This repo is nothing more than my, Bo Lan's, resume. I always use LaTeX to edit my resume. If you are also interested in writting your resume in LaTeX, you can use this repo as an example.

Right now I do not have full time position, so if you are an employer and intersted in hiring me, please compile and read it. Thank you.
